# AngstlessVR

Welcome to VResearch's angstless VR game, the first-ever game to combat GAD via CDBT
=======================
Recalibrating our brain is a difficult process. It requires constant mental effort to counterplay years of learned responses, which often stem from adverse life experiences. Our inaccurate thoughts often lead to actions with consequences that can reinforce our negative thinking or emotions. This further complicates the process of reshaping what we know does not suit our needs but seems too difficult to shake off.

This cycle can be broken by repeatedly and wittingly engaging in behaviors, activities, and thoughts that challenge the unproductive beliefs and replace them with more healthy ones. A computer game facilitates this process by creating a virtual environment that promotes and rewards desirable actions while penalizing less helpful ones. It allows users to experience desired behavior with positive outcomes, stimulates the brain's reward system, and reshapes behavioral patterns. The more the game is played, the stronger the result.

Aim:
---
We believe that the immersion in virtual therapy will create an exposure effect similar to in vivo experience.

_In addition to that:_ The game mechanics should be designed to promote the learning process by proactively encouraging and rewarding desired behavior. The learning curve should be faster than that of an in vivo experience.
